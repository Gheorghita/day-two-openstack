Artifacts to support a hands-on lab @ [OpenStack Summit in Berlin](https://www.openstack.org/summit/berlin-2018/summit-schedule/events/21923/simplifying-day-two-operations-with-ansible-a-hands-on-lab).

The _playbooks_ directory contains playbooks to setup the instances used in the lab, as well as some day 2 operations meant to be performed against them. The _webapp_ directory hosts a sample application that is deployed on the instances. The _docs_ directory contains all the lab exercises that were covered in OpenStack Summit in Berlin.
